So I have moved to a small town called Higashikawa (東川) in Hokkaido, Japan.

It has around 8,000 residents, and half of the town is in the Daisetsuzan National Park (大雪山国立公園), including Asahidake (旭岳), the highest mountain in Hokkaido.

Previously I have lived in Sapporo (札幌), the biggest city in Hokkaido with around 2 million people, for 2 years. Before that, I was in Tokyo and other places in Japan and outside Japan, like the U.S., the U.K., Ireland, Singapore, etc.

I come here for the wonderful nature, the calm environment, and the seemingly vibrant community; more than half the population here are originally from outside the town.

Here I want to share my time in this lovely town by the mountains.
